# Python problems
Random Python scripts:

## Word Intersection
#### Task
The current working directory contains two files, words-1.txt and words-2.txt, each contains a sequence of words, one per line. Write a Python script named word-intersection.py which outputs only the words which occur in both sequences(without duplicates, one per line and in alphabetical order).

## Word Translation
#### Task
The current working directory contains a file named translation.txt. That file defines word translations; for each line,
the first word translates to the second word. See the example, below.
Write a Python script named word-translation.py which reads a sequence of words from standard input (one per line) and,
for each word, outputs the translated word.
#### Example translation.txt
""" 
one eins
two zwei
three drei
four vier
five funf
six sechs
seven sieben
eight acht
nine neun
ten zehn
"""
